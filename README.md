# OSF

Created the parts: 3.1 (HEADER), 3.2 (NAVIGATION), 3.3 (NAVIGATION ON MOBILE), 8.2 (LOG IN DIALOG).
I tried using SCSS but I know there are many things I can improve on.
Only made the desktop and mobile parts for now, still have to include the table media queries.
I still have to make adjustments to some of the texts and still have to include the "onclick" part for the mega menu.
